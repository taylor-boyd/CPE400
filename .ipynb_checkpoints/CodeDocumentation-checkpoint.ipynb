    "This program runs optimally with prerequisites that must be satisfied. <br /> The program uses Jupyter Lab / Notebook which is based off the installation of Python. Python3.3 or greater or Python2.7 is required for Jupyter. Jupyter Notebook works similarly to Jupyter Lab. To install Jupyter Lab, one of the ways can be <br /> <br /> **pip install jupyter lab** or with conda **conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab** <br /> <br /> Once that is installed, required libraries must be installed. This includes NumPy and sklearn. To install NumPy, the following commands can be used. <br /> <br /> **pip install numpy** or with conda **conda install numpy** <br /> <br /> To install sklearn, the following commands can be used. <br /> <br /> **pip install -U scikit-learn** or with conda **conda install scikit-learn** <br /> <br /> The following versions were suffient enough for compilation. <br /> Python 3: 3.8 <br /> Jupyter Lab: 0.33.12 **or** Jupyter Notebook: 6.1.4 <br /> Sklearn (scikit-learn): 0.23.2 <br /> NumPy : 1.19.4 <br /> \n",
    "## **To run:** \n",
    "Use the command in the command line or terminal -> **jupyter lab** preferably in the same directory as the .ipynb file. The command will provide a link to the Jupyter web interface where you can select a file. Double click the .ipynb file and click the **\"Run\"** button that is in the tool bar above the notebook. Using **(Ctrl + Enter)** works well as a shortcut.\n"

    "This function handles sending the packet through the network, and changing the node's energy based on the transmission power, the number of nodes, and the size of the packet. It handles scenarios when there is only one hub, as well as when there are multiple hubs. To ensure safety of delivering the packets, the program checks if all the nodes being used have sufficient energy to transmit the packet. This function will run on loop until all the nodes have no more energy. To prevent having to recalculate the paths for the same hub, we are able to store the previous optimal path for that hub in the hub's routing table. If that path is still valid (all the nodes can still handle transmission of the packet), then that will be the path used. If a new route needs to be found, the program will choose the next viable path."

    "This program runs optimally with prerequisites that must be satisfied. <br /> The program uses Jupyter Lab / Notebook which is based off the installation of Python. Python3.3 or greater or Python2.7 is required for Jupyter. Jupyter Notebook works similarly to Jupyter Lab. To install Jupyter Lab, one of the ways can be <br /> <br /> **pip install jupyter lab** or with conda **conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab** <br /> <br /> Once that is installed, required libraries must be installed. This includes NumPy and sklearn. To install NumPy, the following commands can be used. <br /> <br /> **pip install numpy** or with conda **conda install numpy** <br /> <br /> To install sklearn, the following commands can be used. <br /> <br /> **pip install -U scikit-learn** or with conda **conda install scikit-learn** <br /> <br /> The following versions were suffient enough for compilation. <br /> Python 3: 3.8 <br /> Jupyter Lab: 0.33.12 **or** Jupyter Notebook: 6.1.4 <br /> Sklearn (scikit-learn): 0.23.2 <br /> NumPy : 1.19.4 <br /> \n",
    "## **To run:** \n",
    "Use the command in the command line or terminal -> **jupyter lab** preferably in the same directory as the .ipynb file. The command will provide a link to the Jupyter web interface where you can select a file. Double click the .ipynb file and click the **\"Run\"** button that is in the tool bar above the notebook. Using **(Ctrl + Enter)** works well as a shortcut.\n"
